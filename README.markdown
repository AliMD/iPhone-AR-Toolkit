# iPhone ARKit  FORKED#

## Overview ##

This version of the iPhone ARKit is a modification of the ARKit started on GitHub.  

### Goals of the project ###
-Not depended on a specific View Controller.
-No code in the appDelegate.
-Use CoreLocation coordinates and update location as the user moves around. (not yet completed.) 
-Use CoreData to store coordinates (Not yet implemented.)
-Ability to use both the Landscape and Portrait modes (Almost done, sort of working but will be improving this. Portrait and Landscape right works (Landscape Right is not 100%))
-Ability to add different type of views to augment. (Not yet implemented.)
-Ability to touch any of the augment views to handle other tasks. (Not yet implemented.)



iPhone ARKit's APIs are modeled after MapKit's. For an overview of MapKit, please read [the documentation](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference/index.html) for more information.

## Current Status ##

This is a very early stage is is not ready to be used in existing projects. 
It's possible to run the toolkit with the current ViewController, but it's currently not the ARKit it needs to be to add to your project(s).

## Acknowledgements ##
I would like to thank Zac White for starting the initial project and giving me the ability to fork his code and make the changes I see to make an awesome ARKit.
